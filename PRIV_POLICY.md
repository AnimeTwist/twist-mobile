# In short

We don't log or share your personal information.

We don't track you, we don't profile you. Period.

# The longer version

_We believe privacy is a fundamental human right._

**We do not store any data about you whatsoever.**

We physically can't. We have nowhere to store it. We don't even have a server or a database. What happens on your device, stays on your device. We welcome all audits. Anyone can inspect our source [here](https://github.com/smoke-trees/twist.moe).
